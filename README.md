# Automated Deployment Pipeline for School Administration CRUD Web Application

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an automated deployment and configuration pipeline for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application, specifically tailored for school administration tasks. The project employs a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach, utilizing Unified Modeling Language (UML) as the Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) to define the application's architecture and behavior.

The core objective is to streamline the process of transforming high-level models into a fully functional web application, capable of handling typical school administration functionalities such as student enrollment, staff management, class schedules, and more. The automation pipeline encompasses the entire lifecycle from model creation, code generation, to deployment and management of the application.

### Key Technologies

### Key Technologies

- **DSML**: Unified Modeling Language (UML) for defining models of the web application.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot for robust and scalable server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring quick and reliable updates to the application.
- **Containerization**: Docker for creating isolated environments, enhancing the consistency across development, testing, and production.
- **Orchestration**: Minikube for managing containerized applications, providing a lightweight Kubernetes environment for testing and development purposes.

### Project Goals

- To utilize MDE practices for efficient translation of UML models into a functional web application.
- To automate the deployment and configuration process, reducing manual intervention and promoting consistency.
- To demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using MDE in conjunction with modern software development and deployment tools.
